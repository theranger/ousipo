# About
This project contains a clean and minimalistic theme for statically generated sites using a [Statiq.dev](https://statiq.dev) framework. It is based on the
original (but now abandoned) [Oulipo Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/blog/2010/08/16/new-theme-oulipo/) theme. Some elements of the original theme have been
removed or rewritten. Mainly the search component is abandoned since it cannot be fully supported on static sites anyway.
